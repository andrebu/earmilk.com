EARMILK Stylin'

At EARMILK we try to give our contributors as much freedom as possible, so they can express themselves accordingly. We’re not going to restrict what artists you want to write about so we’ll just be outlining the bare minimum we want to see out of a writeup. The following is a style guide & tutorial on the basics of how we post on EARMILK. Everyone using similar styles will allow our readers to easily find what they are looking for in each post, as well as give our website a cleaner more polished look.

4. Festival Coverage guidelines
1) General content rules

You should be posting at least 2 times a week. Consideration for editorship, festival attendance, etc., is based on exceeding this minimum.
Try to post the day of release, or max 2 days after. Any longer than this and your writeup should be included in a weekly feature (e.g. The Club for dance tracks).
Write on the entire release, not just one track from it. If there are 4 tracks on an EP, touch on them all (or the best few) in your writing.
If it’s a big release, check earmilk.com and WordPress to make sure someone isn’t already covering it
If you work for a firm in this industry (PR, Radio, etc.), you may not post content directly related to your day job. You may pass content along to other writers to review, and they may post on it if, in good conscience, they believe it is newsworthy.
We don't post previews of tracks as the main content of a post. However, if you post on a release that came out today and really want to add an official preview of an upcoming track, that is ok.
Make sure SoundCloud content is from an official Artist/Label account
If we post on a video, it will normally be the "official music video”
Unless under very, very rare circumstances, we do not use YouTube to stream a track. It should be officially released and we can stream through SC or upload it through Mook Tools
Follow the style guides provided to you
Quality over quantity for posts on releases
Balance your taste with our audience’s and remember our need for coverage.
An editor may assign you an article. Please be prepared to do it.
Interviews must be approved by an editor and there should be relevant topics to cover: new album, DJ starts producing in a new genre, etc.
Except for hip hop, mixtapes should be exclusives or premieres.
2) Post formatting

Title

Although titles appear to be uppercase on the website, be sure not to type in all caps as this is done automatically for the front page. On google, rss feeds, and many other locations the title will appear as you type it, so don’t type in all caps.
Post title capitalization will take sentence form, meaning only the first word and proper nouns will be capitalized. See http://www.bbc.co.uk/ for examples.
EP/LP and album titles will have ‘single quotes’ around them only in the post title. In the body text of the post, EPs, LPs, and albums will remain italicized every mention with no single quotes. Tracks will have “quotation marks” around them.
Release title information (track/EP/album title) must be in the post title along with artist names. All words in the release will be capitalized, unless the artist stylized the title differently.
Keep titles short! If it's longer than the viewable space seen in the WordPress title field, it is likely too long.
Try to be witty when appropriate.
Put important information (artist/release title) first.

Posting Special Content: some posts have content we want to alert our readers to with a tag in the title. If you can’t smoothly include these in your title, feel free to add them as tags at the end. Some common ones are: music videos [Video], mixtapes [Mix], exclusives where we are given private links to host content [Exclusive], premieres where we negotiate being one of the first to share a track [Premiere], free downloads [Download].
                Witty Rock’s ‘Morning Breath’ EP smells sweet [Premiere]
J1K remixes Big L's legendary track "Put it On" [Download]

Posting Interviews: another special kind of post, but the interview title depends on the content inside. When the interview does not coincide with any extra special content, the title should be, EARMILK Interview: Artist/Interviewee’s Name or used the [Interview] tag.

Article Header/Picture

On all EARMILK posts we use a dedicated picture that is shown as the first image or piece of content just under the title. A cornerstone of our visual brand, every post throughout the website (lists, previews, etc) must include one in order to pass the editor’s approval process.
How to Get A Post Header Picture

All header pictures (what you see at the top of the post) are done by our in-house creative team. Let’s repeat that, all header pictures are done by our in-house creative team. We hope that relieves some pressure on your part as you’ll be leaving it to our Photoshop whizzes to take care of the aesthetics.
That doesn’t leave you off the hook though. First you’ll have to search through milky tools gallery to see if the artist you’re writing about has already had his or her’s picture touched up by the team. The earlier you check this, the better, as you don’t want to be scrambling to get a picture processed an hour before an interview goes up. Bookmark this link below, as it will be your go to spot for finding any header pictures that have graced the pages of EARMILK in the past.
http://mooks.earmilk.com/gally/
When you find the photo, click on it. It should expand and a button “generate milky image” should appear. Click on that button to open another page, then click “copy to clipboard” button to copy the image URL. Go to your post and paste the URL into the “featured image URL” field on the bottom right hand side of a wordpress post in the section titled “Upload external image and set as featured”.
If you can’t find the artist you’re looking for, chances are we haven’t done a post on them yet. This is where you can make a request to our creative team through requesty: http://mooks.earmilk.com/requesty.  The requesty form is as follows:
your name
your email
artist name
image URL - this should be a Google or Flickr image search, or an imgur/Facebook album with a number of photos for our designers to browse. (Google is your best bet)
special requests - this is where you can include links to specific photos that the artist’s management may want or clarifying information for the designers, like, “the band now only has 3 members.”
You will receive an email confirmation when the request has been completed. If it says “updated” this means you can find the artist picture in the Gally under their name. If it says “filler,” this means you should use a filler image.
Sometimes you’ll get a really fresh artist that hasn’t whipped up good or any press photos at all. Or maybe the topic you’re writing about just doesn’t have a face, whatever the case may be you can will be told to use a “random” or “filler”. You can find them on the front page of the milky tools gallery, they’re usually scantily clad women or cheeky milk references or a combination of both.
How to Add Header Images

In case you missed it above:
Search for the artist in the gally.
When you find the image, click it.
The image should expand and show a button “Generate Milky Image.” Click that button
The image should open in a new page. Click “copy to keyboard”, to the right.
Go directly to the post in Wordpress and paste the copied URL into the “featured image URL” field on the bottom right hand side section titled “Upload external image”
Click “upload” and the draft will be saved
NOTE: If this is a news post, you will not have a “header image”. However, you will have a featured image (normally a flyer for an event or some photo given to you in a press release). Please cut this image to 585x250px , then upload it and set it as the featured image.

Body

This is where your pencil and creativity goes. Write-ups are a minimum of 4 to 5 sentences or at least 5 lines of text when you preview the post on the front page.
Don’t be pressured to go long and don’t be scared to go short. Sometimes you’ll want to write a beefy track by track review to turn some heads or a quick couple sentences is all you need, just do what feels right to you and make sure to cover the basic info requirements.

Below you’ll find what we expect to see in your writing as well as the font format you’re responsible to know. Please note that some formatting does not transfer properly from word processing software to Wordpress. Therefore, make sure to re-do the formatting on the post in Wordpress.
Things to Always Include:
EARMILK in all caps (this applies to any location: body text, titles, emails, soundcloud, etc.)
Artist name(s) in bold ONCE, the first time you use them.
Track titles in “quotes”
Album/EP titles in italics
Release date (if pending) in bold
Record label name in bold
Tour/Festival names (if any) in bold
Where the artist/label is from (just country or city is ok)
Links to BUY the music you are writing about—generally at the bottom of the post
So let’s break things down a bit:
Bold
Italics
“Quotes”
- artist name (once)
- upcoming release dates
- record label names
- Tour/Festival names
- album/LP/EP titles (note EP/LP should never be italicized)
- upcoming albums/LPs/EPs
- mixtapes
- track titles
Here’s an example - this would be the minimum amount of writing to get your post approved, pay attention to font format and the information that’s packed inside.
Excerpt from a post on The Black Dog by philipjamesdevries
http://www.earmilk.com/2011/09/06/the-black-dog-liber-temple/
British techno legends The Black Dog are some of the most influential players who have helped to define IDM and electronic music of the 1990s and 2000s, alongside other major names like Aphex Twin and Autechre.  September saw Dust Science release “Liber Temple” – The Black Dog’s second installment of the Liber singles series.  This group of 12″ singles have come after the release of their critically acclaimed take on Brian Eno’s Music for Airports, entitled “Music for Real Airports”.
Tunes

Download Policy

Unless the track is up for download by the artist, it should be streamed. We no longer offer free downloads of anything and everything. Also, due to the advent of Facebook plugins and Soundcloud, many artists make you pay for the track by “liking” their page and such. It is up to you whether you want to grab the track and put it on EARMILK as a free DL, or post a stream of it and direct our readers to the proper download link on the Artist Facebook or Soundcloud (sometimes the soundcloud embed download link won’t show up on our site). A heads up: keeping good artist relations is key in this business, so, if you like the artist and want them to like you back, often the latter course of action is better.
Uploading Tunes to EARMILK

If you’ve gotten the keys to our milky tools database you may be wondering what goes on in there. Think of it as our super duper iTunes library rammed with pretty much every single mp3 we’ve talked about in the past few years. It also hosts our gallery and many other things but we’ll get to that some other time. Bookmark this link below because it will be your weapon of choice when it comes to sharing your taste with the world.
http://mooks.earmilk.com
To upload a new mp3 from your computer
Make sure you scrub the track properly. That means removing any host site text, formatting featured artists and remixers correctly, etc.
Click “addy” at the top
In the Select Files box click on the button that says “Add Files” with a green (+) sign
Browse through your PC or Mac to find the mp3 you’re looking for and select it
you can select multiple files at once and upload them at the same time if you’d like
Click on the “Start Upload” button with the green arrow
Wait for the track to upload, you can track the percentage to the right
Embedding Tunes
When it reaches 100% your track(s) have just been successfully uploaded to our server, once that happens
Click “browsey” at the top
The file should be near or at the top. Check the box or boxes of what you want to upload
Click “generate wpness” on the right hand side
You can sort the order of your tracks or delete unwanted ones in the next page by dragging up or down or deleting them with the trash can
If you’re satisfied with the order click “generate wpness” again
This will take you to the generate html code. Copy all of this into the Text (HTML) tab of your post on Wordpress. When you view the post on the Visual tab, it will, and should, look a bit different. You can move around tracks in your post by cut and pasting the code in the Visual tab to organize the layout of your writeup. Many tracks that you process through Mook Tools will not be for download. Look in the next section for an explanation on how to modify the code to make a track stream-only.
You can throw tracks in between paragraphs as you discuss them (much easier on the reader & more engaging for longer written topics) or you can include them as a list at the bottom of the post. The first method is highly recommended (if only in part) to help break apart content & encourage reading.
Streams

It’s always best to stream through Soundcloud as it gets pulled to Hypem. Try to find the track in question by using the Soundcloud search engine, as it may already be uploaded to the record label or artist’s account. If that’s not the case, you can always use EARMILK’s account just hit up one of the editors and they will take care of it. See Download Policy for more Information.
Pay close attention to how you should modify the Soundcloud player so it fits the look of our site. This is crucial to keeping our pages clean and should never be looked over.
Embedding Soundcloud:
Click ‘share’ on the Soundcloud player
Copy the short code link from the “WordPress” field at the bottom
Then copy the code into your post on the Visual tab
Note: While you should always try to get the short code [soundcloud url="http://api...true" /] sometimes you will be given the iframe code <iframe width...</iframe> for embedding. If this is the case, then you can copy the code into HTML mode of your post. But, you should always attempt to obtain the wordpress shortcode.
Embedding Stream-only tracks from Mook Tools:
For tracks that are stream-only and NOT downloadable, you must remove part of the HTML code.  In the Text/HTML tab of WordPress, change “Download:” to “Stream:” and then remove the code <a href=”http....mp3”>. For example (changed items in bold):
Original
<p>[audio:http://files2.earmilk.com/upload/mp3/2013-06/Daniel-Kandi-Feat.-Sarah-Russell-Change-The-World-Estiva-Remix--EM0613.mp3]<strong>Download:</strong> <a href="http://files2.earmilk.com/upload/mp3/2013-06/Daniel-Kandi-Feat.-Sarah-Russell-Change-The-World-Estiva-Remix--EM0613.mp3"><strong>Daniel Kandi Feat. Sarah Russell</strong> - Change The World (Estiva Remix)</a></p>
Stream-only
<p>[audio:http://files2.earmilk.com/upload/mp3/2013-06/Daniel-Kandi-Feat.-Sarah-Russell-Change-The-World-Estiva-Remix--EM0613.mp3]<strong>Stream:</strong> <strong>Daniel Kandi Feat. Sarah Russell</strong> - Change The World (Estiva Remix)</a></p>
Media
Adding Photos:
All header photos must be edited by our creative crew (see above section “Article/Header Picture”)
To add a photo to the body of the post (maybe you are reviewing a festival and want to add some spice), click the “Add Media” button at the top of the post.
On the left hand side, you may either select “insert media” to upload files from your computer, or “insert from URL”
Upload Files:
Click the center “Upload Files” button and select the file from your computer, then select the appropriate size (normally “large”) from the menu in the bottom right corner
Click “insert into post” and the image will be added in the space your cursor was last in
“insert from URL”
Find the direct URL  for the photo, normally the link you get if you right click and “copy image location”
Paste the URL into the provided field and click “insert from URL” at the bottom right
You will have to drag the image corners to resize it to 595px
If you are posting a track or EP/LP, it is recommended that you include a picture of the album art itself somewhere in the post (normally at the bottom, so see the section below titled Bottom).
Resizing Photos:
Click on the image that’s added to your post and drag the corner till the dimensions are correct. If you uploaded from your computer, the “large” size you inserted should already be 595px.
OR
You may also click on the image then click on the mountain button that appears in the top left corner
A window should appear where you can edit the name, size, etc.
Click on the Advanced Settings tab up top
Fill in the width and height parameters (width must be 595 - remember image needs to be proportional)
Embedding Videos:
Use the widgets on the Wordpress editor menu to embed videos into your post
Located beside the font size and paragraph menu
Make sure you are using the appropriate widget, i.e. Youtube widget for Youtube videos, Vimeo widget for Vimeo videos, etc.
Try to stick to the widgets as much as possible when you’re embedding videos
Sometimes you’ll want to embed a video that doesn’t have a widget, in that case try to find a mirror that’s hosted on one that does
If it can’t be found you can embed the video player through HTML
Links:
Hyperlinking
Highlight the word you want to link (try to select one word)
Click on the little chain button in the editor menu of Wordpress
An Insert/Edit Link window will pop up
Copy and Paste the URL you want to link to into the URL parameter
Make sure to include the full url including (http://www.)
Make sure to check the box “open link in new window/tab”
A title is not necessary so you can just press “Add Link”
Link formatting
Links to artist/label pages, social networks, and where to buy releases will be in bullets at the bottom
Other references can be hyperlinked within the text itself
Footer
Release artwork and links related to the music in the article - where to buy, artist page, record label page, etc. - will be included at the bottom of your post. You have two options: insert a milky review builder, or insert the full artwork followed by the proper links. Regardless of the chosen option, the links you include will be one online retailer (preferably Beatport, iTunes, or Juno, if the track is for sale), followed by common social networks (Facebook, Soundcloud, Twitter), and, if necessary, official web pages.
Milky Review Builder
If you want to insert a condensed and “pretty” version of the artwork and links, use the Milky Review Builder. In the top right row of Wordpress formatting buttons, you will see a black and white button with a # sign on it (). Hovering over it, it should say “Milky Review Builder”.
Insert the album artwork at the bottom of the post, size 250x250px. If you are uploading from your computer, select “medium album” for the size. If you insert from URL, drag to 250px.
Select the photo by clicking on it, then click the Milky Review Builder button.
A form will appear. Enter the information as you would in a post title and be sure to add the label and release date.
Enter the link information on the right. Please remember that the links all need http://www. before the rest of the URL.
Click “insert das review”
Example: http://www.earmilk.com/2013/05/14/cajmere-sonny-fodera-youre-the-one-pleasurekraft-remix/

Full Artwork
If you don’t want to insert the artwork as such, or want to place more than 3 links. You will insert the artwork at 595x595px below the last part of your post (text, song, whatever). The artwork will be followed by the proper links.
Min. 1 / Max. 5 in Point Form bullets
Pay attention to the way the links are organized in the example below. It is also important to have some writing above the bullets that can be from your body or info on past releases the reader should look back at or future releases to look forward to.
Excerpt - taken from a review of Damu’s Ridin’ EP
http://www.earmilk.com/2011/10/01/damu-ridin-ep/
Peep the B-sides and if you feel like investing in organic gold grab the 12″ on Boomkat. Check out his past EPs especially Mermaid and Gargoyle which features remixes by fellow square pushers Jack Dixon and Nguzunguzu. A cat definitely worth a follow as he delves further into his own electronic psychedelia. Expect support from the likes of Night Slugs and many forward thinking artists.

Categories
There are a number of categories to describe the music (for example: dance, progressive house), as well as categories to describe content (exclusive, interview).
Tags
Make sure to tag your post and that the tags are spelled correctly! You should tag artists, festivals, labels, and so on. Make sure they are relevant and make sure they are not categories.
Featured image/Upload external image
Every post needs a header image, which was explained in the first part of this guide.
Artist Twitter Details
Enter up to 3 artists’ twitter handle/s in the field provided. Don’t put your own there... That’s cheating.
Interview Formatting
All interviews must be approved by an editor
Interviews will be in question/answer format (obviously). For the first question and answer, the site name and artist name will be spelled out in bold. For the second, third and so on questions and answers, the initials will be used in bold. 1) When formatting the interview in wordpress, please highlight the entire question, then select “interview question” from the style drop down menu in the tools pane.  Similarly, highlight the entire answer, then select “interview answer” from the style drop down menu in the tools pane. 2) The questions and answers will alternate green and red in wordpress.
